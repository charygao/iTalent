Students from different departments of PXL have to work a required number of hours to a chosen project. Projects can not always be achieved by one or a few students, that's why there is an need for an online platform where students can launch ideas and / or subscribe to it. Cooperation with various departments can be promoted that way and students have the opportunity to participate in projects that are in line with their interests. Of course, it is not intended that any idea can simply be released. This requires the consent of supervising teachers. Teachers can approve projects, monitor and possibly support (partially). To use this application it's required to login and is therefore only accessible only for students and teachers of the PXL.",
